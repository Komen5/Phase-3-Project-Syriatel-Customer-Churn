    "## PROJECT OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to build a model that effectively predicts customers at risk of churning. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes 20 features mainly related to customer usage patterns, and consists of 3,333 records. Of these, 483 customers are identified as churners, while 2,850 are non-churners. The goal of the model is to classify the \"churn\" target variable using classification algorithms. The model's performance is evaluated using recall as the metric. Ultimately, the decision tree model, fine-tuned with hyperparameters, proves to be the most effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "For telecommunications companies, growing their revenue base relies on both gaining new customers and enhancing customer retention. A major challenge for large enterprises is customer churn, which occurs when a subscriber or regular customer ends their subscription or stops doing business with the company. Churn can be driven by various factors, such as switching to a competitor with better prices, leaving due to poor customer support, or disconnecting from a brand because of limited engagement opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syriatel, a mobile telecommunications and data services provider based in Damascus, Syria, offers a variety of services, including calls, messaging, GSM, and internet. The company has earned a strong reputation by focusing on customer satisfaction and social responsibility. Syriatel understands that maintaining long-term customer relationships is more cost-effective than constantly acquiring new customers. Therefore, predicting customer churn has become a crucial part of the company's strategy. This project aims to create a model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn and pinpoints the key features leading to this prediction. With this information, Syriatel can take proactive steps to prevent customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- To develop a machine learning model that can effectively predict customer churn using the information provided in the dataset..\n",
    "- To pinpoint the key features that play a significant role in predicting customer churn.\n",
    "- To provide recommendations on specific actions the Syriatel company can take to reduce churn based on model insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "The primary evaluation metric for the classification algorithm is recall, focusing on correctly predicting customers at risk of churning. The ultimate objective is to minimize false negatives, as failing to detect a potential churner is more costly to the business than misclassifying a non-churner. A reliable model should achieve a minimum recall of 85%. However, a model predicting all customers as churners to maximize recall is not valuable, as not all customers will churn. Therefore, precision and accuracy will be monitored as secondary metrics."

This model excels in achieving the highest recall score, and its accuracy and precision scores are well above average.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "* The chosen model for predicting customer churn is the decision tree with fine-tuned hyperparameters, boasting the lowest count of false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key features crucial for forecasting customer churn are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Total Day Minutes: Reflects the cumulative minutes spent by the customer on daytime calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Total Evening Minutes: Sums up the minutes spent on evening calls by the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Customer Service Calls: Indicates the number of calls the customer has initiated to reach customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recommendations\n",
    "- **Customer Service Strategy:** Syriatel should ensure a robust customer service strategy to meet customer expectations effectively and assess customer interactions. This includes tracking and addressing both positive and negative feedback from customers.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resolve Customer Issues:** Since customer service calls have the highest correlation with churn, implying that the more times a customer initiates a call to reach customer service, the more likely they are to churn. Syriatel should ensure that issues raised by clients who call are resolved promptly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Charge Rates:** Given that total day and night minutes are key factors for predicting churn, Syriatel should assess its call charge rates in comparison to competitors. Lowering the charges per minute for calls could prove instrumental in retaining customers and preventing churn."
